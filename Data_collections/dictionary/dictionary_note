* represented using {}
* values represented as key-value pair
    eg: dc={'name':'anu','age':5,'class':3}
        print(dc)
    o/p
        {'name': 'anu', 'age': 5, 'class': 3}
* key must be unique but values can be repeated
* if one key is of int type then succeeding keys must be integers
* empty dictionary is creating as
    dc={}
* set is represented same as dictionary
    s1={1,2,55,4,76,34}    dc={'name':'anu','age':5,'class':3}
* but the empty set and dictionary is represented as
     s2=set()            dc2={}
* dictionary is mutable
* nesting is possible
* hetergenous(can contain different types)
